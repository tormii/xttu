* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).
My undergraduate research advisor is Prof. [Xuefeng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h47O1xYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the general area of signal processing and machine learning, particularly in sparse representation and deep learning,
as well as their applications in fault diagnosis, condition monitoring and healthcare.
